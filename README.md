#FTB Bot for CurseApp 

## Running Instructions:
* The bot requires the location of the config file as a command line argument such as -c /home/me/bot/myconf.conf
* A sample config is located in config/sample.conf
* a mongo database is not required, but without one the functionality of the bot will be very limited.

## Logging
* logs are stored in the console and a file
* the file's location can be changed by setting the `FTBBOTLOG_FILE_LOCATION` environment variable
